## Publishing

First of all, we can make use of [GitHub](http://github.com) to cooperate with others.


### Markdown Again

* [Cloud Based Markdown Editors](Cloud-Services.html)
* [Mou](http://25.io/mou/) (Mac)
* [MarkdownPad](http://markdownpad.com/) (Win): if you have no bad feelings about .NET
* [ReText](https://sourceforge.net/p/retext/home/ReText/) (All platforms | Open Source)


### The Documentation Generators

Make use of these softwares for publishing

1. [Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org): RestructuredText as source, powerful, flexible.
2. [Gitbook](http://www.gitbook.io/): A new but promising tool for html, pdf etc.
3. [Git-scribe](https://github.com/schacon/git-scribe)
4. [Wordsmith](https://github.com/tractical/wordsmith)


#### Sphinx Themes and configurations

As an example, we'll demonstrate a little bit of the usage of Sphinx.

##### Themes

1. [rtd theme](https://github.com/snide/sphinx_rtd_theme)
2. [some beautiful themes](https://github.com/vkvn/sphinx-themes)
3. [bootstrap theme](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/sphinx-bootstrap-theme/): quite comfortable


##### Science Books Using Sphinx

1. [Theoretical Physics](https://github.com/certik/theoretical-physics)
2. [Statistical Physics](https://github.com/emptymalei/StatisticalPhysics)
3. [Physics Research Survival Manual](https://github.com/CosmologyTaskForce/PhysicsResearchSurvivalManual)



### Hosting

0. [ReadtheDocs](http://readthedocs.org/): Turn your restructuredtext source to html, pdf and epub, all done online.
1. Host source on [GitHub](http://github.com) or [some other git services](Be-Organized.html).
2. Deploy HTML on [gh-pages](https://pages.github.com/) is the easy and beautiful way.

### Blog / CMS

Before doing the investigation on platforms, just remind yourself:

**I want to write, not run blogging software.**

#### Deploy And Go



#### Blog/CMS Softwares

These softwares are running on the server and can be
