## Be-Organized


### Version Control System

First things first, everyone should know version control systems. Version control is one of the most useful tools for scientists.

* git
* svn
* mercurial

#### Online Git Service

* [GitHub](https://github.com/): No description needed.
* [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org): Alternative to GitHub with free private repositories for small teams (up to 5 users).
* [GitLab](http://gitlab.org/): Similar to GitHub and BitBucket, can be both cloud-based and self-hosted. It includes
  unlimited free private repositories, issue tracker and a continuous integration tool.


#### Self-hosted Git Server

* [GitLab](http://gitlab.org/): See above at [Online Git Service](#online-git-service).
* [Gitorious](https://www.gitorious.org/): Acquired by GitLab and discontinued, but [the software](http://getgitorious.com/) can still be installed.


#### Enterprise Git Service

* [Rhodecode](https://rhodecode.com/)
* [Codeplane](https://codeplane.com/)



### Pomodoro

Try [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) to gain efficiency and probably health.


* [Pomotodo](https://pomotodo.com/) (`Cloud`,`Mac`,`Win`,`Android`,`iOS`,`Chrome`): A mix of todo list and pomodoro timer, with sync across devices and weekly report [Free].
* [Tadam](http://tadamapp.com/) (`Mac`): Simple and elegant pomodoro timer [USD$ 4.99].
* [Productivity Challenge Timer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wlxd.pomochallenge&hl=en) (`Android`): Pomodoro timer with great gamification features [Free].


### GTD-Task Manager

The GTD (Getting Things Done) method rests on the idea of moving planned tasks and projects out of the mind by
recording them externally and then breaking them into actionable work items. This allows one to focus attention on
taking action on tasks, instead of on recalling them ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done)).
Tasks can be classified in contexts (@home, @computer, @office, etc), time of action (now, next actions, scheduled or
someday) and projects. [Here](https://hamberg.no/gtd/) we have a good pragmatic guide to GTD and
[here](http://gettingthingsdone.com/pdfs/tt_workflow_chart.pdf) a flowchart.

* [Wunderlist](https://www.wunderlist.com) (`Cloud`,`Mac`,`Win`,`Android`,`iOS`,`Win Store`,`Chrome OS`): Almost perfect todo lists with cooperation and sharing.
* [Evernote](https://evernote.com/) (`Cloud`,`Mac`,`Win`,`Android`,`iOS`,`Win Store`): Not so lightweight but still very good for managing life especially since it has got a lot of integrations from a lot of other services.
* [Anydo](http://www.any.do/) (`Cloud`,`Mac`,`Android`,`iOS`): Good because it has a very good daily review which can help users remember what to do.
* [Todoist](https://todoist.com/) (`Cloud`,`Mac`,`Win`,`Android`,`iOS`): Todoist invented the karma system which keeps track of the tasks done.
